================


Manage the multi recurring cost on products + a flag for EPL products.

Manage an API to get information about the BSO Network (set up on
res.company). Members of the group "BSO Networking CRUD" can manage the network
information.

Heavy customization of sale orders:

* manage network information on sale order lines when the product is an EPL.
* manage a duration of the contract and the computation of the total amount of
  the contract (with MRC)
* this is reflected in sales invoices.
